An incomplete but fun game of blackjack

The impressive aspect about this game of blackjack is that it dynamically creates a deck of cards as objects that are stored in a digital deck and can be popped from the stack and shuffled.  These deck of cards hold the suite name, the card number, the value of the card and other information to be used in not only blackjack but any card game.

Since each card is individual they can be removed and added to the deck. Everything is handled as seperate objects. Even the player and the dealer.
